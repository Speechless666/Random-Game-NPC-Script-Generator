# Random-Game-NPC-Script-Generator
our project bridges the gap between static scripted NPCs and dynamic, AI-driven characters, benefiting both the gaming industry and academic exploration of human–AI interaction.

## 🚀 Getting Started (To Fix Compatibility Issues)

To avoid Python environment conflicts (like the "Requirement already satisfied" error when the import still fails), you **must** use a **Virtual Environment (Venv)**. Please follow these steps exactly.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Do note that requirement.txt is under \project 
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Speechless666/Random-Game-NPC-Script-Generator]
cd [https://github.com/Speechless666/Random-Game-NPC-Script-Generator/project]
